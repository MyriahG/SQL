-- For this project I ran queries from a table for a Digital Media Store.  

-- #1 Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceID, BillingCountry, InvoiceDate
FROM invoices
LEFT JOIN customers 
ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId
WHERE BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

-- #2 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT EmployeeID, LastName, FirstName, Title
FROM employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

-- #3 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT LastName, FirstName, InvoiceID
FROM Employees
JOIN Invoices
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';
